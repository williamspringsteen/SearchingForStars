Avoid the yellows

Can get hit 3 times / have 3 lives

Powerups (One can make you repel for a short time)

Make movement a little more controllable (It is definitely important to stop infinite acceleration)

Collectibles

Score counter

Can shoot? (Perhaps from a powerup you get 10 bullets or 10 seconds of shooting)

Spaceship themed? And powerups add something to your ship temporarily/permanently (So actually add it on to the sprite!)

Sprites for enemies/rocks/whatever they are going to be

Multiplayer (Local - one on WASD, one on arrow keys) - literally just stick two players in it, and they can shoot each other too now, maybe more powerups based on affecting the other player like cap-pow

Settings - Key bindings, accessibility (colour blind, etc)

Difficulties (Less powerups spawning, more enemies spawning)

Able to change colour of base ship, or choose from multiple ships, or choose what your powerups look like when added to ship

May have to make yellow things despawn at some point, or at least think of a better way to get rid of them, either with better shooting or cool powerups like bombs

Static/slowly moving obstacles to use strategically (i.e. to hide behind, maybe gets moved by bomb)

Stop things spawning near player

Different types of enemies (More attracting [However, this may make it unfairly hard since you can't account for all these varyingly attractive enemies], maybe bigger ones that shoot of varying difficulty) that spawn at different rates

Achievements

Pause button/menu

Make sure difficulty is balanced (such as how much powerups affect you, how much enemies attract, how easy it is to avoid enemies, how fast enemies spawn)

Change background

Bosses that appear (Have to be bombed/shot) (Maybe only appear in single player)

Maybe make enemies spawn faster as game goes on (May not need as it may be easy to get overwhelmed after a while, or bosses might just stop players playing forever)
